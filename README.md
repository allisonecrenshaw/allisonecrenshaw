- Recurring event patterns and reusable genres for finding and filtering events

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- Deepening my expertise in **backend API development** and **database design** through developing the API for my dance event platform
- Learning front-end development using React so that I can build the front-end for my dance event platform

## 💼 Past Experience
### 📱 Backend Development for Mobile Trivia Game
During my time at Atmosphere TV, I worked on a highly synchronous online mobile trivia game.

During this project, I started in manual QA and transitioned into a software development role where I:
- Implemented features for our API to enhance user experience, improve system efficiency, and provide new functionality
- Developed scripts for data imports and edits to manage our trivia database and tweak existing question banks to fit with the evolving vision of trivia
- Designed and implemented a database rearchitecture to increase the adaptability of our trivia game structure  

### ✔️ SDET & Manual QA Experience
Prior to transitioning into development< I worked in both automated and manual QA. I have experience in:
- Developing automated integration tests for the API using the Karate automation framework
- API endpoint testing through Postman
- Bug identification and investigation through code exploration
- Manual mobile app testing (Android & iOS) and TV app testing (Android & tvOS)
